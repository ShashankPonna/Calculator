# 🧠 Logic Explanation
- First Value, Operator, and Last Value are tracked separately.

- Buttons update the display and internal variables based on user input.

- The eval() function performs operations.

- Additional checks prevent invalid decimal placement or incomplete expressions.

- % is custom-handled for calculating percentage-based expressions.
